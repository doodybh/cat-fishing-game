i need to make sure that zooming in in the page doesnt affect where the stuff addEventListener

make sure to add a hook at the end of the line.

if possible make the circle be overlapped on top of the line so fish can be seen pulled out visually from the hole.

add lives.

make fish swim all the way til they leave the screen.

a lot of css should be worked on. (this is only a prototype to make sure functionality is there.)

i need to make hitboxes for the fish (circle hitboxes at their mouths or near the front of their faces would probably sufficient.)
